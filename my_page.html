<h1>A Tale of two cities</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1: The Period</h2>
<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was
    the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it
    was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were
    all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present
    period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the
    superlative degree of comparison only.</p>

<p> There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a
    large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to
    the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.

<h2>Chapter 2: The Mail</h2>
<p>It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this
    history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He
    walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the
    least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and
    the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach
    across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard,
    however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the
    argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their
    duty.</p>
